Scenarios that we will cover
============================

1. You want to run something that requires a lot of computing power,
   or will take a while, and you don't want to run it on your laptop.

   (Boot up an instance, use it until you're done, terminate it.)

   Tutorials: boot instance; transfer files; use screen for command line.

2. You want to check to make sure that your install and execute
   instructions work when starting from an empty machine.

   (Boot up an instance, use it until you're done, terminate it.)

   Tutorials: boot instance; transfer files; use screen for command line.

3. You want to run something that requires software you can't install on
   local computers.

   (Boot up an instance; stop it when you're not using it; terminate it when
   done.)

4. You need more disk space on an instance, but only when running things.

   (Add more disk space to the root when booting; OR, add ephemeral disks.)

5. You want to store data persistently on Amazon, and use it when

6. You want to make large data files available to other people for download.

   (Use S3.)

7. You want to make large disks available to other people (colleagues and
   collaborators).

   (Use snapshots.)

8. You want to install a bunch of software, build an AMI, and make it available
   to others.

2. Editing files locally, vs editing files remotely.
